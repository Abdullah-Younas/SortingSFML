**SFML SORTING**
Learning Sorting in SFML
1/18/2024:
          I started with Bubble sort since this was my first try doing something like this it was kinda fun Since i don't know how to work with arrays and sorting algo that much but with a bit of help I managed to do it,
The color is a bit off I dont know why it happened and I was'nt that upset about it so I let it as it is.
Next I'll try a Diff Algo.
